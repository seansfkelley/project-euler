# Generate the shortest bit string that contains every n-bit number from 0 to 2^n - 1 as a substring for any number n.
#
# Example for n = 2:
#
#   00110 or 10011
#
# These strings both contain each of the four 2-bit strings 00, 01, 10, 11 and are the shortest strings to do so (and may not be the only 5-character strings).
